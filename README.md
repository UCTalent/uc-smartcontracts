# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```
clean                 Clears the cache and deletes all artifacts
compile               Compiles the entire project, building all artifacts
console               Opens a hardhat console
coverage              Generates a code coverage report for tests
                        npx hardhat coverage --testfiles ./test/token/token.js 
flatten               Flattens and prints contracts and their dependencies
help                  Prints this message
node                  Starts a JSON-RPC server on top of Hardhat Network
run                   Runs a user-defined script after compiling the project
test                  Runs mocha tests
typechain             Generate Typechain typings for compiled contracts
verify                Verifies contract on Etherscan
                        npx hardhat verify {address} --network networkName "Agrs (optional)"

GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js       Run script deploy
```
